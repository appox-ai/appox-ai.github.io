# How to Create or Edit an Article 

---

When searching for a topic in the **[AppOX's][appox]** Wiki and you don't find an article discussing what you're looking for, feel free to create one from scratch.

If you've read an article in the Wiki and believe the document could be improved, don't hesitate to propose changes.

In the top right corner of the page, you'll find the **Add new** link to create a new article or the **Edit** link to suggest changes to the article you're reading. These links will take you to [Github][github].

![Github file editing][edit]

Depending on your user privileges, [Github][github] will guide you on how to proceed.

If your user account is already associated with the repository, it's as simple as [Github][github] directly showing you the file for editing or creating from scratch, and then making a [pull request][pullRequest] afterward.

If your account isn't associated with the repository, [Github][github] will prompt you to [Fork][fork] the repository to your account. After making changes, you can submit a [pull request][pullRequest] from your fork to the **[AppOX's][appox]** repository.

Write your article using [Markdown][markdown] or [HTML][htmlBasics] syntax.

If you'd like to preview how your [Markdown][markdown] text will look before publishing, you can use [Dingus][dingus].

If you need to include images in your article, upload the image to the ***assets/img/*** folder of the repository and in your document, indicate that the image is at the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appox-ai/appox-ai.github.io/master/assets/img/image_name.

If you need to include a resource other than an image, such as a PDF, upload the file to the ***assets/files/*** folder of the repository and include a link in your document directing to the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appox-ai/appox-ai.github.io/master/assets/files/file_name."
